## CONDO Project
Condo is a project to create a simple and easy to use tool to manage a
condominium. It is a web application that can be used by the condominium
administration to manage the condominium and by the condominium residents to
manage their own condominium.

### Why another Condo?
There are many condominium management tools out there. However, most of them
are either too expensive or too complex. This project aims to create a simple
and easy to use tool to manage a condominium.
