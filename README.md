## CONDO Project
[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/yellowsnow/condo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yellowsnow/condo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Condo is a project to create a simple and easy to use tool to manage a
condominium. It is a web application that can be used by the condominium
administration to manage the condominium and by the condominium residents to
manage their own condominium.

### Why another Condo?
